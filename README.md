### This is my portfolio for data analytics projects:


1) [Cohort Analysis](https://github.com/IvanAks777/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Cohort_Analysis/cohort_analysis_project.ipynb "Cohort Notebook")
   The project involves the Cohort Analysis of Retention Rate by Day. In short you can check out  the resulted  [Cohort graph](https://github.com/IvanAks777/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Cohort_Analysis/data/Cohort.png "Cohort Heatmap")
   * 1.1
2) [RFM Analysis](https://github.com/IvanAks777/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Olist%20E-commerce%20metrics%20and%20RFM%20analysis/aksyonov_project.ipynb "E-commerce and RFM") is my project about real e-commerce data getting from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce). The stages of analysis:
   * 2.1 Data Preprocessing(cleaning) and merging (denormalization).
   * 2.2 EDA - Exploritary Data Analysis
   * 2.3 Calculate and Visualize essential metrics of e-commerce(Revenue, ARPU, AOV, CLTV, top categories in terms of order and revenue). I start by time series analysis of Revenue: monthy, daily and rolling daily aggregation. Then find the percentage of growth year over year. Next, calculate ARPPU by month and daily rolling. After that, I count the number of orders per customer. Finally, I check out top categories in terms of orders and revenue.
   * 2.4 I segment the customers using RFM analysis. The [RFM Segments Treemap](https://github.com/IvanAks777/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Olist%20E-commerce%20metrics%20and%20RFM%20analysis/pictures/newplot.png)
